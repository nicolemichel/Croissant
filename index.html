    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry associated with
      France but originated in Austria. Croissants are named for its historical
      crescent shape and, like other viennoiserie, are made of a layered
      yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry.
